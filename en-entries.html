<b>Caution!</b><br>The following manual is an extension to the: <a href="en-change-trains.html">How to change the train set in the scenery</a> manual, with which you should familiarise yourself with first (So that you'd know what to do with the entries, etc).
<b>Read the whole thing and then start!!!</b><br><br>
<br><b>LOCOMOTIVES:</b><br>node -1 0 <span style="color: orange;">EU07-150</span> dynamic <span style="color: red;">PKP\4E_v1</span> <span style="color: green;">4E-150</span> <span style="color: blue;">4E</span> 0.0 <span style="color: teal;">headdriver</span> <span style="color: navy;">3</span> <span style="color: gold;">0</span> enddynamic<br><br>
<b>WAGONS, CARRIAGES, EMUs and DMUs:</b>
<br>node -1 0 <span style="color: orange;">SN61-168</span> dynamic <span style="color: red;">pkp/sn61_v2</span> <span style="color: green;">sn61-168.dds</span> <span style="color: blue;">sn61</span> 0.0 <span style="color: teal;">headdriver</span> <span style="color: navy;">63</span> <span style="color: gold;">40</span> <span style="color: purple;">passengers</span> enddynamic<br><br>

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li><b>-1</b> - Maximal visible distance of the model (meters); -1 is infintie, which in practice is 2km; In order to slightly improver the FPS, decrese this number, to say 800.</li>
<li><b>0</b> - Minimal visible distance (mteres).</li>
<li><span style="color: orange;">SN61-168</span> - Vehicle name, displayed in Rainsted.exe; in case of locos or MUs it <b>HAS</b> to be unique (In MUs and multi-section locos, each vehicle has to have a unique ID) on the whole scenario; but freight wagons and passenger carraiges can have repeted names.</li>
<li><b>dynamic</b> - Object type. Dynamic, simply means any vehicles moving on roads or tracks.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;">pkp/sn61_v2</span> - File path from inside the <i>Dynamic</i> folder. To change the vehicle, simply replace the "sn61_v2" with another vehicle folder, such as "et22_v2". Another main folder (alternatives for <i>pkp</i>) is for example <i>road</i>, which contains road vehicles, whose entries are analogous to the railway vehicle entries.</li>
<br><ul><li>The old standard for file paths was to use the Windows backslashes, as well as using small and capital letters. <b>New standard is to use the forward slash and all small letters.</b> So, it used to be; "PKP\SN61_V2", and now it's ment to be "pkp/sn61_v2"</li></ul><br>
<li><span style="color: green;">SN61-168.dds</span> - Texture file name, along with it's extension. If the model has nor replaceable textures, we write <b>none</b>.<br>Advenced user information: If we don't type in the extension, the simulator will try to use the default file extension. For 735 kB exe(exe from the Dizelpack) and older, the default is .bmp, however for exe from PC2009 and newer, it's user defined (it has effect on the whole Simulator, not just the vehicle entries!) in the <i>eu07.ini</i> configuration file. The <i>defaultext xxx</i> entry is the one responsible for it (example: if we write tga instead of xxx, the default extension becomes tga).</li>
<li><span style="color: blue;">SN61</span> - Shared .fiz and .mmd file name of the vehicle, which we're putting on the scenery (these files are in the previously defined "dynamic/pkp/sn61_v2" folder).</li>
<li>0.0 - Field currently not used</li>
<li><span style="color: teal;">headdriver</span> - Staffing situation:
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>headdriver - driven from the front cab</li>
<li>reardriver - driven from the rear cab</li>
<li>nobody - unstaffed. Used in the rear section of dual-sectioned locos (ET40, ET41, ET42), when running two or more locos in multiple (for example 2 x EU07) <b>in the second one</b> and in all MU vehicles, except the very first one (in it we use the "headdriver")</li>
<li><span style="color: purple;">63</span> - <b>The so called "coupling" number.</b> <u>The sum of the below numbers</u>, defining the type of the coupling used between this and the next vehicle in to the rear. <b>Furthermore</b> we can also add different modificators, by adding a dot, and then the modificators, at the rear of the coupling. For example: <b>3.BR</b> 
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
	<li>0 - None, no physical connection (used when the vehicle is the last in the train set);</li>
	<li>1 - Mechanical connection (Screw-link);</li>
	<li>2 - Main Brake pipe (<i>Red hose</i>);</li>
	<li>4 - Multiple working jumpers;</li>
	<li>8 - High Voltage jumpers;</li>
	<li>16 - Gangway;</li>
	<li>32 - Auxilary air hose (<i>Yellow hose</i>).</li>
	<br>
	<li>Moddificators: (Can be used in multiples, for example: 63.BP.WF9P100H99.TA)
		<ul>
		<li>W - Wheels</li>
			<ul>
			<li>FxRyPz - Size of the flat: 
				<br><b>x</b> - guaranteed size, in mm
				<br><b>y</b> - random increase, in the range of 0 - y mm (optional entry)
				<br><b>z</b> - probability of the flat, in procent. (optional entry)</li>
			<li>Hxx - Chance of bogie hunting only on this vehicle, xx in range of 0 to 100</li>
			</ul>
		<li>B - Brake settings</li>
			<ul>
			<li>R - Rapid setting</li>
			<li>P - Passenger setting</li>
			<li>G - Goods setting</li>
			<li>O - Brakes disconnected</li>
			<li>Q - No air in the Main Reserouir at the start</li>
			</ul>
		<li>T - Temperature</li>
			<ul>
			<li>A - Forces the vehicle elements to have the ambient temperature of the scenery (~15'C)
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<br>
<li><span style="color: gold;">40</span> - load amount. <b>For locos, set to 0</b> The method of counting the loads (in tonnes, pieces or only in passenger vehicles, passengers), is described in the .fiz file, specified earlier. The <b>LoadQ</b> parameter describes whenever it's <i>tonnes</i> or <i>pieces</i>.</li>
<li><span style="color: purple;">passengers</span> - Type of the load. Here, the .fiz file again, tells us what kind of loads it can take, by the way of the <b>LoadAccepted</b> entry. For example, freight wagon for bulk cargo, type 401W, we can choose one of few loads;(<i>Coal, Stone, Wood, Lumber, Sand, Gravel</i>) or leave the wagon empty. In that case, we put 0 as the amount and <b>LEAVE THE TYPE BLANK.</b> Otherwise, durining loading of the simulator, it will crash.</li>

<p>The aboce mixed freight train set, has all wagons set to the Passenger setting, with a ET42 unit in multiple. The first ET42 unit has 17mm flats, and both have a 100% bogie hunting chance. First carraige has 40 passengers, the 2nd one is empty. The coal wagon is carrying 10T of coal, and can have a flat of between 10mm and 20mm, with a 15% chance of having a flat.</p>
