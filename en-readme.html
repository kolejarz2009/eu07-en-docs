<h2><a name="2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The beginning of MaSzyna dates back to the year 2001.  It was mainly a graphic engine test. The simulator got it's current shape in 2003. Since then, it's continously developed. Thanks to many people's work, many different railway vehicle models have been created, as well as many scenarios, textures and sounds. It has to be noted that everything here was created in spare time, as a hobby. For this reason, not everything is created in a professional manner, like in the commercial products. If you have time and want to help us, then join us!

<!--In the mean time the work on Symulator Pojazdów Trakcyjnych (<b>SPT</b>) [ Rail Vehicle Simulator ], the successor to the worn-out program. It is based on OSG engine, which offers better capabilities.--> 

</p>
<div class="powrot"> 
	<span><a href="#0">Contents</a></span>
</div>
<h2><a name="3">I've downloaded the simulator, now what?</a></h2>
<h3><a name="3,1">Installation?</a></h3>
<p>
No. You do not install MaSzyna. After downloading the MaSzyna 15.04 package, it needs to be <i>extracted</i> to a new folder. Do not extract the package to an existing folder with MaSzyna, since 15.04 is NOT a mod or an update for any existing packages like PC 08.13 or any other older versions of MaSzyna. To extract, we recommend the free software "7-Zip" version 9.20 (to download from <a href="http://7-zip.org">http://7-zip.org</a>), since using WinRAR might cause problems.
</p>
<div class="powrot"> 
	<span><a href="#0">Contents</a></span>
</div>
<h3><a name="3,2">First run</a></h3>
<p>
To launch MaSzyna, use Rainsted launcher, created by Ra. It functions as starter and a train consist editor (but also a realistic scenery editor, more on it further down and more information is on <a href="http://rainsted.com/">rainsted.com</a> [Polish only])
Enter the main MaSzyna folder. Launch <i>Rainsted.exe</i> (icon like in screen 1 below).
</p>
<img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/1.png" alt="Screen 1: Rainsted launcher icon"><!-- it can also look like this: <img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/1old.png" alt="Screen 1: Rainsted launcher icon">-->
<p>
You should see the following window (screen 2):
</p>
<a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/2.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/2_mini.png" alt="Screen 2: Rainsted (launcher)"></a>
<p>
Durning first run, Rainsted launcher processes and generates certain configuration files. It can take upto around a minute. It is a one-time process - every other launch of Rainsted will launch much quicker.
<br>
Rainsted was succesfully started when the following window appears (screen 3):
</p>
<a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/3.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/3_mini.png" alt="Screen 3: Rainsted, Choose Scenery tab"></a>
<p>
The titlebar says: "Wybierz scenerię :: MaSzyna EU07-424 :: Rainsted 15.1.108.10181". The "15.1.108.10181", is not <!-- - contrary to what may people think - --> Simulator version number, but the version of the Rainsted Launcher and changes when Rainsted is updated.
<br>
Go to <i>Settings</i> (or <i>Ustawienia</i> if the Launcher started in the Polish language) and in the <i>Select language</i> (or <i>Wybór Języka</i>) and choose your preferred language.
<br>
From here on, we assume that the language was set to English.
<br>
<i>Settings</i> tab (screen 4) allows for configuring such parameters, like screen resolution.
</p>
<a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/4.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/4_mini.png" alt="Screen 4: Rainsted, Settings tab (in Polish)"></a>
<p>
The important setting in the <i>Settings</i> tab, is the <b>User mode</b>. It can be changed, depending on the knowledge of the user. 
This setting affects <i>Rainsted</i> <b>ONLY</b> and has no effect on the simulation whatsoever. Let's look at options from the "Settings in EU07.INI" pane. These DO affect the simulation. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fullscreen mode - Before checking this, it is recommended to choose a resolution from the list on the left, which is compatible with the display.</li>
<li>Fix for monitor refresh frequency - Check this, if the screen flickers.</li>
<li>Multisampling - This allows for smoothing of jagged edges, so: better quality, worse FPS. Can be regulated, from 1(off) to 16.</li>
<li>Debugmode - More about it <a href="inne/readme_pliki/en-debugmode.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Writing "log.txt" - Very important option. When checked, everytime the simulator runs, it generates a file in the main directory called "log.txt". It contains information, is are extremely important when solving problems that occur durning scenario loading. If you do not have problems with the Simulator, uncheck this option, the CPU will be less loaded, and you might gain few FPS.</li> 
<li>Writing vehicle parameters - It generates a "[vehicle name].dat" file for every vehicle, in the "physicslog" folder. On weaker computers, might cause the FPS to drop. We suggest you use this option only when planning on using the "HTV" software (more in the FAQ).</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The remaining options should be left as they ware. <!-- Always checked (except for: <!--day-night cycle, which was not implemented and --><!--Traction seeking, which might cause lower FPS on weaker computers; more in the FAQ). They allow for certain functions, which ware not available in the older versions.-->
</p>
<p>
 In the <i>Choose scenery</i> tab, is a list of all the available sceneries. As you can see, we have tens of different scenarios. In the beginning, we will choose the simplest route, to become aquanted with the Simulator. Choose the <b>TD</b> scenario, in the <i>Select trainset to drive</i> pane, click on EP07-424+BD+BDHPUMN+BDHPUMN and press <b>Run Simulator</b>.
</p>
<div class="uwaga">

<b>Important Notice</b><br>
After choosing any scenarios and the trainsets, familiarise yourelf with the information in the middle field of the <i>Select scenery</i> and the right field from the  <i>Select trainset</i> (for example scenario calkowo_orlen.scn; screen 5), and also with any possible descriptions, available after pressing the buttons (in the middle field of the <i>Select scenery</i> pane, or in the "inne/[scenario name] (not all routes have it [for example <i>TD</i> doesn't have one]).
 <br><br><a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/5.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/5_mini.png" alt="Screen 5: Rainsted, Scenario description"></a>
</div>
<p>
 A window will appear (screen 6):
</p> 
 <a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/6.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/6_mini.png" alt="Screen 6: Rainsted, Starting Information"></a>
<p>
 Familiarise yourself with the starting information (the are shown only for a couple of the most used vehicles; full description of keys and controlling the trains will be further down in this read me file. Next, press <b>Run simulator</b>.
</p>
<!-- Ra: Should be fixed already
<div class="uwaga">

<b>Important notice</b><br>
If in the <i>Informacje  startowe / Startup information</i> you do not see the <b>Run simulator</b> then close that window. Then go to the <i>Settings</i>, and set the <i>User mode</i> to normal or higher and uncheck the <b>Steering description(?)</b>. Then, again, choose your scenery (<i>Choose Scenery</i> tab), in the  <i>Select trainset to drive</i> tab, click on the set you would like to drive. Then press on the  <b>Run simulator</b> button.
</div>-->

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Time for the most important stage</b></span><br>
After a moment (no more than a minute) the startup screen window should appear (screen 7).
</p> 
 <a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/7.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/7_mini.png" alt="Screen 7: Symulator MaSzyna - startup screen window"></a>
<p> 
 It may vary from the one on the screen, since the launcher chooses one at random before displaying it. In certain cases, the "Uruchamianie / Initializing" text may not be visible, however, it does not influence the simulation in any way and should be ignored.
</p>
<p>
 After few seconds, the logo may (but doesn't have to) turn into a white background, or fade slightly (Windows Vista oraz 7). In this moment most user panic, thinking the Simulator got suspended / is hanging. <b>That is not the case</b>. It is still laoding all the necessary files (eventhough, the Task Manager [and on the simulator's titlebar, screen 8 i 9]may show it to be &quot;Not responding&quot;).
</p>
<a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/8.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/8_mini.png" alt="Screen 8: MaSzyna Simulator- Startup screen, Windows XP and older"></a><a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/9.png" title="Click, to enlarge.."><img 

src="inne/readme_pliki/img/9_mini.png" alt="Screen 9: MaSzyna Simulator - Startup screen, Windows Vista & 7"></a>
<p>
To find out about that, all you have to do is press <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>Tab</kbd>. Then we will see the &quot;terminal&quot; (on Windows Vista and 7, switching to the terminal durning loading only works if the <i>Fullscreen mode</i> is unchecked; and then, once the simulator has loaded, the <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>Tab</kbd> combination works normally, even in fullscreen mode). We will be able to watch the simulator loading process. Sometimes, it can stop for a while on the stage shown on the screen 10 (Sound Init&#8230; OK) , however, it won't stay there forever :)
</p>	 
	 <a href="inne/readme_pliki/img/10.png" title="Click, to enlarge."><img src="inne/readme_pliki/img/10_mini.png" alt="Screen 10: MaSzyna Simulator - loading of the sim in the terminal"></a>
<p>	 
	 You just need to wait untill it finishes loading.
</p>
<div>
	 The scenario has loaded when the following is displayed in the terminal:<br>
	 <div class="quote">Player train init OK</div>
</div>
<p>
	 We should be automatically moved to the cab. If not, we switch into the window with the simulation, by using <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>Tab</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
After the cab has loaded, we begin the simulation in the standing position, as if we just entered into the cab, through the doors. To sit down at the controls, press right mouse button.
</p>
<p>	 
If durning loading ( or after, durning the simulation) a notification is displayed, that the program has carried out a incorrect operation, that it has stopped responding / working or that there was a fault with the application, it means that, most probably you have very old drivers for your graphics card (In these cases, it is very common that in the first few lines of <i>log.txt</i> the following test is displayed: "OpenGL Version: 1.1.0"). In that case, in order to run the Simulator, download (for example from the graphic card's maufacturer's website) and install newer drivers (in some cases it may be necessary to uninstall previously installed (the older) drivers ; in some cases, "DriverCleaner" app may be of use ).

<h3><a name="5,2">Changing Cabs</a></h3>

In order to move to the other cab, press either:
<ul>
<li><kbd>End</kbd> - move towards cab B (cab A, is normally the one in which the simulation began in).</li>
<li><kbd>Home</kbd> - move towards cab A (in case of being in cab B).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Attention: in between the cabs, there is the "Engine Room" (in some locos, it looks like a green room). If you are in the Engine Room, then press either <kbd>Home</kbd> or <kbd>End</kbd> (depending on the direction in which you plan on going) for a second time. When changing cabs in Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) and locos that have more than one unit, you will need to press <kbd>End</kbd> or <kbd>Home</kbd> a couple of times (for example, in EN57 we press <kbd>End</kbd> twice, to move from <b>ra</b>(Driving Trailer unit) unit, to unit <b>s</b> (Motor Coach), and then <kbd>End</kbd> three times, in order to move to <b>rb</b> unit, and then finally press <kbd>End</kbd> twice, to enter the cab). Changing cabs means that the Sim need to load it's model, that's why after pressing <kbd>Home</kbd> or <kbd>End</kbd> it is necessary to wait (for it to load).<br><br><b>ATTENTION!</b><br>If we are driving a vehicle in Multiple Working, or it is a double-unit loco, or a EMU, it is important to check if the Independant/Loco brake is in the Running position ("brake off"). We also should set the Train / Combined Brake to Cut-off position(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Num 5</kbd>). After entering the second cab, we need to press kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>. If we do not do this, then after a minute of driving, the loco will stop, since in the first cab, the CA (Polish for DSD (Driver Safety Device)) will engage (and stop the train).

<h3><a name="5,3">Coupling and uncoupling</a></h3>

<h4>COUPLING UP A LOCO TO THE CARRIAGES</h4>

<ol>
<li>Drive up to the train (don't leave the cab), when you feel that you buffered up (Drove up to the buffers, and slightly hit them), move the throttle wheel up 2-3 positions, and brake using the Independant Brake (reminder: <kbd>Num 1</kbd>).<br>WARNING!: If, when buffering up, the carriages "run away", then leave the cab, <kbd>F4</kbd> fly up to two, three carriages and brake them using the Handbrakes, holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Num 1</kbd>. When you are done with the whole coupling-up precedure, fly up to those same carriages, and hold  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Num 7</kbd> in order to release the handbrakes.</li>
<li>Exit the cab - <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
<li>Get as close to the coupling  as possible - imagine you are coulping them up yourself. It's not enough to come close vertically, you also need to move horizontally. In majority of cases, you should also lower you self a little bit by using <kbd>PageDown</kbd>.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> twice - you will hear the characteristic air leak sound and a model of a coupled-up screw-link coupler will show, along with the "red hose".<br>If you, additionally, want to connect the Main Reservoir Pipe ("Yellow hose") then press <kbd>Insert</kbd> once more.<br>WARNING: Sometimes, the couplings and the hoses won't move, it doesn't mean that the loco has not connected up to the carriages.</li>
<li>Go back to the cab - <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
<li>Unbrake the loco - <kbd>Num 7</kbd> and go to the other cab.</li>
</ol>

<h4>UNCOULING A LOCO FROM THE CARRIAGES</h4>

<ol>
<li>Brake the whole train, pressing the <kbd>Num 3</kbd> for around one second, from the Running position.</li>
<li>Unbrake the loco only - <kbd>Num 6</kbd>.</li>
<li>Move the reverser backwards by 2 positions (2 x <kbd>r</kbd>) and select the 2nd or 3rd position on the throttle, to buffer up to the carriages, and brake using Independant brake (rem.: <kbd>Num 1</kbd>).</li>
<li>Exit the cab - <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
<li>Get as close to the coupling  as possible - imagine you are uncoupling them yourself. It's not enough to come close vertically, you also need to move horizontally. In majority of cases, you should also lower you self a little bit by using <kbd>PageDown</kbd>.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> once - you will hear the characteristic air leak sound.</li>
<li>Go back to the cab - <kbd>F4</kbd>.</li>
<li>Unbrake the loco - <kbd>Num 7</kbd>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>COUPLING UP TO A TRAIN THAT ALREADY HAS A LOCO</h4>
<p>
To couple up to a train on the same track, drive up to it gently. After you buffer up, brake using the Independant brake. In order to prevent a runaway train, it is vital that you perform a Full Service brake application or at least a "?Supplementary Application?" (<kbd>Num 8</kbd>).<br/>

WARNING: If your train is to be coupled up to a train driven by AI, (ie. you drive a Banking Engine or the AI hauls our loco/train ), then it is absolutly necessary to set the Train Brake in the Cut-Off Position (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Num 5</kbd>)!<br/>
If the user drives the train, then the Train Brake valve must stay in the braking positions, and the reverser must be in either forward or backwards positions. This deactivates the AI !!.

After the above has been completed, one can now start to couple the couplers <kbd>Insert</kbd>. The moment the coupler is connected (after the first <kbd>Insert</kbd> key press ) AI "being" in the set is either deactivated (Train brake in the braking positions) or it's activated (Train brake in the Cut-Off position). If you make a mistake (choose wrong action), then decouple, set the Train brake in the correct position, and try to couple up again.

<h2><a name="7">Package information</a></h2>
<p>
MaSzyna 15.04 is based on previous versions (08.13, 01.13, PC2011, 2010, 2009). This version has largely focused on fixing the layout of the catenary on the sceneries, in order to fully utilise the new feature of simulating the contact between the pantograph and the catenary, and improving the catenary power-supply chain.<br />

<h3><a name="7,1">Improvements and new EXE functions</a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Extended catenary power supply-chain usage and simulation — currently, each individual catenary sections can be powered from two sides,, voltage drops due to the loads being applied are taken into account, it's possible to overload the substations.</li>
    <li>The pantograph and catenary interactions.</li>
	<li>AI reacts to signs about the catenary.</li>
	<li>Power conroller positions ware altered — added the correct operation of the single-way camshaft on the EN57 and the "group" cam shaft in ET22.</li>
	<li>Random event delay — it is possible to get a delayed event execution.</li>
	<li>LoD distance calculation— if the vertical resolution is other than 768 pixels, the LoD (MinDist and MaxDist) phase change distance will be calculated accordingly.</li>
	<li>Improved pantograph animations — Currently the pantograph components are measured from the model, and based on these, the animation's parameters are calculated.</li>
	<li>Extended start-up procedure — it is possible to start the loco up without the air, which requires the three-way valve to be switched and the use of auxilary compressor.</li>
	<li>Display the sound subtitles: after adding <b>lang en</b> into <i>eu07.ini</i> file, the English subtitles will be visible, and if you add <b>lang cz</b> — czech, and <b>lang hu</b> — hungarian subtitles will be displayed instead.</li>
	<li>Opacity parameter interpretation change — currently for values of 100 the submodel is rendered in the opaque phase, and semi-transparents / translucents are NOT rendered.</li>
    <li>Improved car traffic behaviour on road intersections / junctions.</li>
    <li>Battery usage was added.</li>
    <li>New lamps ware added in some cabs. Kilometer(Mileage) displays ware added, and animation handling was rebuild, allowing to have loads of gauges (Speedometers, ammeters, voltmeters, manometers and rotometers), as long as they show the same value.</li>
    <li>Muting of unnecessary sounds.</li>
    <li>"All clear for departure" signals from the guard.</li>
    <li>Independant point blade animation.</li>
	<li>The SM03 loco can now work in two gear ranges. AI can also use this function, and also drive SN61.</li>
	<li>Destionation display board texture and upto four textures on vehicle models. Destionation display board texture is choosen based on the timetable, and can differenciate between types of vehicles (ie different textures between Motor Coaches and Trailing Coaches).</li>
	<li>Also, many vehicle physics fixes, especially in the brakes ware added. Nearly all ware done by comrade youBy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="7,2">New Stuff</a></h3>	
<ul>
	<li>Catenary positions was fixed on majority of sceneries;</li>
	<li>New Polish description of Manewrowo 3 scenery;</li>
	<li>New loco and wagon textures;</li>
	<li>Improved EP09 characteristics;</li>
	<li>Timetable is shown after pressing <kbd>F3</kbd>;</li>
	<li>The BR285 loco model, with the cab;</li>
	<li>The ST43 loco model with the cab;</li>
        <li>New scenarios;</li>
        <li>Numerous fixes for the sceneries.</li>
</ul>
	
<div class="uwaga">

<b>Important notice</b><br>
When the cab has laoded, we begin the simulation in the standing position, as if we just entered the cab through the doors. To sit down in front of the controls, press right mouse button.

<h2><a name="11">Remarks</a></h2>
<h3><a name="11,1">Why is ... not included in this pack?</a></h3>
<p>
In order to understand why the packs don't contain all the add-ons published from the start of the existance of the Simulator, one needs to know that for a couple of years, when it comes to add-on creation, there was simply only chaos. Add-ons often ware not tested before being published (there ware no standards, norms etc), which ment that they had errors, ware incomplete and often, ware incompatible with each other (often adding one scenery, broke all the remaining sceneries). Additionally, addons ware often hosted on external servers, which removed them after some time, which caused the forum to was full of dead links, instead of addons. Only at the end of 2008, thanks to Ra, it was possible to clean up the mess, through gathering everything in "Katalog dodatków" / Addon Catalogue , on the eu07.pl server. But to simply have all the addons in one place wasn't enough. The addon publication process was reorganised (from the end of 2008, every single addon, prior to publication, must be subject to mandatory tests). However, the incomplatability problem remained, since there was a lack of official and up-to-date package, which could create some sort of an reference point for the testers and creators (last, unofficial package was published half-way through 2006, however the last official, in 2004). That is why, at the beginning of 2009, a group was created, who spend a couple of months choosing, from previously published addons, the addons that ware worthy and didn't have too many mistakes, and then worked on the inter-compatability of these addons, by removing significant mistakes, filling in the missing files, etc. That is how Paczka Całościowa 2009, 2010, 2011 along with the Service Packs, MaSzyna 01.13 and MaSzyna 08.13 ware created.

Newest Package (called MaSzyna 15.04) is a continuation of that work, and just like the previous Packs, does not contain any low quality addons, or the ones in beta testing.

<h3><a name="11,2">The Simlator's executable file &ndash; EXE</a></h3>
<p>
MaSzyna 15.04 contains "EXE 469" (<i>eu07.exe</i> file, the <b>15.3.1166.469</b> version, 1263 kiB in size, located in the main folder of the Simulator) created by Ra and youBy. It eliminates many mistakes, and contains some new functions. <!--- The EXE also contains hunter's fixes, which intoduce more realistic controls of the electric vehicles. These fixes are so significant, that they change the current keyboard layout, and start-up procedures of the electric vehicles. That is why, we insist on you familiarising yourself with:
<ul>
<li><a href="#4">Readme file - MaSzyna 15.04, "Key control" section.</a></li>
<li><a href="#5,1">Readme file - MaSzyna 15.04, "Control", "Contorlling" section.</a></li>

<h2><a name="12">What next? When is a new version / new add-ons comming out?</a></h2>
<p>
We are hobbists, who divide our time between families, jobs, learning and only in our spare time we can create things for the Simulator. That is why, when asked "When is the new loco/route/pack comming out?" we can not give a 100% accurate (or binding) answer. We are not a group closed to new people and their ideas. If you want to conribute, we will welcome you :) You can, for example, help the add-on creators by photographing the infrastructure, buildings etc. in order to make the routes in MaSzyna more realistic. More info here (Polish Only): <a href="http://eu07.pl/forum/index.php/topic,17369.0.html">http://eu07.pl/forum/index.php/topic,17369.0.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you are good at programming, modelling, sound editing, you have a good camera or simply have laods of spare time, <!-- and you know what is ment by: Python, C++, SCons, OpenAL, OpenSceneGraph --> then we would be happy to work with you on improving the Simulator.
<!-- Symulatora Pojazdów Trakcyjnych (SPT). It will be a new MaSzyna version, based on the OSG engine. It offers much more (especially when it comes to the performance increase, in comparison to the current MaSzyna engine.)-->

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,3">When I drive the train, a red flashing light lights up, and a buzzer goes off, and the train grinds to a halt, and I can't release the brakes. How do I fix this? What am I doing wrong?</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz">It's either the Czuwak Aktywny (CA) or SHP. The English equivalent of the "CA", is the Driver Safety Device (DSD), and the English AWS would be similar in working to the Polish SHP. The first (CA), tests the driver's vigilance whilst driving every so often. The second (SHP), does the same as CA, however, in front of 'dangerous' places (signals etc). If you do not react to the visual and then audioble warnings, the emergency brake is activated. When it lights up, you need to 'cancel' it. In MaSzyna, we use <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> for it. If you, however, don't, then you need to wait for the train to stop completly, 'cancel' the CA/SHP (<kbd>Spacebar</kbd>), and then unbrake the train.</div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,4">Are there any other cameras/views available?</a></div> 
<div class="odpowiedz">You can exit the cab (by pressing <kbd>F4</kbd>) and then you can "walk" over the whole scenery by using the Arrows. If you want to move faster, you can hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while operating the arrow, if slower; hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>. You can also combine both the keys (Ctrl + Shift) to move really quickly. To move up or down, use the <kbd>Page&nbsp;Up</kbd> (go up) or <kbd>Page&nbsp;Down</kbd> (go down) keys.<br><br>In the Free Fly Mode (<kbd>F4</kbd> button), it is possible to define up to 10 custom camera positions and to switch between them. It is done by using the top row number keys (NOT the keypad keys). More Information: <a href="#4">MaSzyna 15.04 Readme file, "Keyboard Controls" section.</a></div>

<div class="odpowiedz">There is no need for manual point switching, everything is done automatically, with the help of 'events' created by the scenario's author. The only scenery where manual points switching is required (and possible), is 'Manewrowo3'. In order to switch the points, we move o the point's lever (similarly like when coupling and uncoupling locos, we literaly have to 'enter' the lever) and press <kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>t</kbd> (for going to the side) or <kbd>t</kbd> (for going straight). We should see the handle move, along with the point blades.</div>

</ul>
Also, in the graphics driver, turn off the vertical synchronisation, anisotropic filtering and all the AA. Yoy could also set the graphics mode to performance. You might also want to experiment with different grpahics drivers. In the case of fairly new cards, it is recommended to use the newest drivers. However if you have an older card, then older drivers might be a better option. If you have an old comupter, then try to turn off all the software running in the background, like any IM, browsers, anti-virus software, music players, etc), since they will only unnecessarly lower the performance of the PC. Sadly, those changes will not cause a miracle rise in FPS, especially if you have an integrated GPU.</div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,22">How to install new addons?</a></div> 
<div class="odpowiedz"><div class="uwaga"><b>Important notice</b><br>The description below, is only vaild for addons realeased after the 3rd of June 2013 only!!  Addons released earlier (such as sceneries(routes),skies, which are not included in the MaSzyna 15.04 release, are NOT compatible with it (15.04 version and above). It is because, for a long time, there ware no standards regulating the publication of addons (For more information, see: <a href="#11,1">MaSzyna 15.04 Readme file, "Remarks" section, "Why is ... not included in this pack?"</a>). If you do choose to install an older addon, remember that you are doing it on your own, and without any guarantees that it will work correctly with MaSzyna 15.04 (and above). remeber also, that we don't provide technical support for older addons. You do have many diagnosic applications, which may show you any missing files (for example Rainsted) and <a href="http://eu07.rainsted.com/archives/filefind.php">File finder</a> and <a href="http://eu07.rainsted.com/archives/">Add-on catalogue / Archive</a>, in which you MAY find those files (if they exist, that is).<br>Remeber also, that in MaSzyna 15.04 has a couple of new vehicle models. That's why, certain textures found in the Add-on Catalogue / Archive are not compatible with the new models (the difference in mapping)</div>In case of files with RAR, ZIP and 7-ZIP file extensions, they are simply to be downloaded and extracted (so that the corresponding folders would match up, ie <i>scenery</i> from the Addon, would end up in the <i>scenery</i> folder on the hard drive, <i>dynamic</i> to <i>dynamic</i> ('scenery' and 'dynamic' are only examples! - not every single add-on pack has these folders), etc.; In practice, it's best to extract the addon onto the main folder with MaSzyna). On top of this, you need to follow the instructions given by the author in the information file (in every single addon pack, there should be a <i>info.txt</i>, <i>readme.txt</i> or <i>czytajto.txt</i> file), thus making everything work, since all addons published (after the MaSzyna 15.04 release) on the eu07.pl forum, in either the 'Publikacje' and 'Download' sections, will fully work with MaSzyna 15.04.<br> In case of a .R_I extension, use the Rainsted launcher, which will automates the addon installation. The file (.R_I) should be dragged and dropped on top of Rainsted launcher icon. ('drag and drop' method). Then, begin the installation, by pressing the <b>Instaluj paczke / Install the pack</b> button on the right hand side of the window. Aftert eh install, a window will appear with the relevant infornation. Then, you need to use the <b>Check current vehicles</b> function, for  the "(Rainsted launcher, Current Vehicles tab).</div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,47">When will a new version, new addons come out?</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz"><p>We're just hobbist, who have to share their time between family, work, learning, and in their limited free time create something for the Simulator. That's why we can't give you a 100% correct and/or binding answer to the "When will a new loco/route/pack be released" question. We are not a closed group, we will welcome any new people and their ideas. We will welcome you if you want to help us in developing MaSzyna :) You can, for example, help the model creators by photographing infrastructure, buildings, etc. All to help the routes in MaSzyna to become more realistic. More details here (In Polish; use Google's Translate): <ahref="http://eu07.pl/forum/index.php/topic,17369.0.html">http://eu07.pl/forum/index.php/topic,17369.0.html</a>.<br>Besides that, we're carrying out work in order to improve the physics in the Simulator. If you have any useful information, diagrams, which could help the improvement, you could write it in the forum, in the correct department.</p><p>If you know how to program, and you know how to use languages like: Python, C++, SCons, OpenAL, OpenSceneGraph then we would welcome you to help us with creation of the Symulator Pojazdów Trakcyjnych (SPT)(Railway Vehicle Simulator). It will be a new version of MaSzyna, based on the OSG engine. It offers more capabilities (especially when it comes to improving the efficiency of the engine, compared to the current MaSzyna engine).</p></div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,48">When I turn on the compressor, everything turns off, and nothing happens. How do I fix that?</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz"><p>It means that you turned the compressor on too quickly after turning on the transformer, and the Transformer MCB switched off. To turn it back on ('unlock it'), turn the transformer off, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>n</kbd>.</p></div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,49"></a>I can't pressurise the Main Pipe after braking / CA/SHP turning on.</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz"><p>In many locos, durning Emergency Brake application, the driver's valve(/handle) becomes cut-off using compressed air. In order to release the brakes, set the driver's valve into the correct position and press and hold the Brake Release Button(<kbd>Num 6</kbd> key) until, the pressure in the Main Pipe rises to 4 bar.</p></div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,50">A while after releasing the brakes, some pressure goes into the loco brake cylinders.</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz"><p>Because of the way the train brake is build, sometimes after the brake is released, there may be little pressure left. In this case, use the <i>Brake Release</i> (<kbd>Num 6</kbd> key).</p></div>

<div class="odpowiedz"><p>Improved pantograph to catenary simulation algorithm cased, all the faults with the catenary placement, may cause the <i>Fast Switch</i> to disconnect, since the pantograph looses contact with the catenary. In cases of extreme catenary mis-alignment, the pantograph may break. If the <i>WN (High Voltage) Voltmeter</i> show the voltage to be present, you can simply carry out the loco starting procedure again.</p></div>

<div class="pytanie"><a name="14,52">When starting off, the voltage suddenly drops to 0V.</a></div>
<div class="odpowiedz"><p>On some scenries (example Quark, Krzyżowa) catenary was divided into sections and connected to power. In case of hard start of couple of vehicles at the same time, it is possible to overcharge the section or even the whole substation. Current will be then temporarily disconnected and then subsequently reconnected. After a third (3) overcharge, the current supply will be disconnected for about one (1) minute.</p></div>
