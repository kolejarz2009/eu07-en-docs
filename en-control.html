<b>STARTING AND DRIVING AN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE</b><br>
<br>Description applies to all electric locos which can be found in the Simulator (EU07, EP07, EP08, EP09, ET21, ET22 [also the ET22-2000_v2 version], EP05, EU05, ET40, ET41, ET42, EU04, 181). The difference between individual locomotives is generally the brake valve, which is described in more detail further down. At the end, we also have descibed the changes in the controlling of the ET22-2000 and the ET42.<br><br><b>Choosing the direction of travel - Setting the reverser</b><br><kbd>d</kbd> Go forward (&#8222;Forward&#8221; position)<br><kbd>r</kbd> Go backward<br>Attention: If the reverser is in the  &#8222;Forward&#8221; position, in order to go backwards, you need to press the <kbd>r</kbd> key twice.

Before the compressor is turned on, the <i>Pantograph Reservoir</i> needs to be isolated from the <i>Main Reservoir</i> by the use of the <i>Three-way valve</i> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, since the <i>Pantograph Compressor</i> is not capable of charging the <i>Main Reservoir</i>. After raising the pantographs and turning on the <i>Main Compressor</i>, it is necessary to connect the <i>Pantograph Reservoir</i> with the <i>Main Reservoir</i> <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, otherwise the panthographs will come down, due to leakage of the pantograph's pneumatic system.<br><br>

<br><b>STARTING AND DRIVING A DIESEL-ELECTRIC LOCMOTIVE</b><br>
<br>We control the Diesel-Electrics (SM31, SM41, SM42, SP42, ST44 [także M62_mod_v1], SU45, SU46, TEM2) in a very similar manner as we do with the Electric locos. All (except the SM41, which uses the H14K1 valve, instruction above) use the FV4a valve.<br>The principal difference is that we don't use a pantograph and we don't 'bypass' the motors (SU45 and SU46 do it automatically, and 'bypassing' in the SM42 and SP42 has not been implemented in the Exe).<br>In some of these locos, to move from standstill,<kbd>Num +</kbd> need to be pressed twice, since the first position (1 x <kbd>Num +</kbd>) close the contactors but no current flows through them. Another difference is the function which [Shift] + [f] do. It does not increase the current range limit. In SM42 and SP42 it switches the loco into Shunt Mode, whereas in other Diesel-Electrics, it has no function. It's [Shunt Mode] description:<br><br>Power Controller to 0 -&gt; <kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>f</kbd> -&gt; Set position using the Power Controller -&gt; using <kbd>Num /</kbd> and <kbd>Num *</kbd> we change the field excitation. <br>Upto 4th position of the power controller we need to set some excitation manually, in order to move, from 5th position we can start without excitation, but it will be slow. <br><br>Turn Shunt Mode off:<br>Power controller to 0 -&gt; <kbd>f</kbd> <br><br>
<br><b>STARTING AND DRIVING A DIESEL-MECHANICAL LOCOMOTIVE</b><br><!--Description applies to SN61. --> <!-- and SM03/04.-->
<br><b>SN61</b><br>Brake operation is the same, as in the case of electric locomotives with the FV4a valve. <!--(for SN61) and the H14K1 valve (for SM03/04).--><br>
<ol>
<li>First set the direction of travel&nbsp; (<kbd>d</kbd> - forwards, <kbd>r</kbd> - backwards).</li>
<li>Then set the power controller tot eh first position (<kbd>Num +</kbd>).</li>
<li>Now the engine starter may be turned on (<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>m</kbd>).</li>
<li>After a sucessfull start-up you can move the power controller one position up (neutral gear) and wait for the <i>Main Reservoir</i> to charge.</li>
<li>Release the brakes. To move the power handle needs to be moved one more position up - the locomotive will roll on a half-clutch, after reaching 7-8&nbsp;km/h you can move the handle up, into normal driving positions (there are 5):
<br>
0: Fuel cut-off<br>1: Engine start<br>2: Neutral gear<br>3: Starting off<br>4: 1. Driving position (15% of fuel dosage)<br>5: 2. Driving position<br>6: 3. Driving position<br>7: 4. Driving position<br>8: 5. Driving position (100% fuel dosage)</li></ol>Please don't burn the clutch.<br><br>
<br><b>SM03/04</b><br> The brake handling is the same as with electric locos with the H14K1 valve.<br>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the engine (<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>m</kbd>).</li>
<li>Turn on the compressor (<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>).</li>
<li>When the compressor supplies enough pressure, the brakes can be released.</li>
<li>Set the direction of travel (<kbd>d</kbd> - forward, <kbd>r</kbd> - backward).</li>
<li>Shift into 1st gear - <kbd>Num /</kbd>.</li>
<li>Give it some gas (<kbd>Num +</kbd>), loco should start moving.</li>
<li>When the engine reaches maximal revs you can shift into the next gear (in between the gears, are clutches). Repeat the operation until the final, 4th gear is reached.</li>
<li>To stop, cut the gas (<kbd>Num -</kbd>), go into neutral gear (<kbd>Num *</kbd>) and brake according to the instructions.</li>

<li>Turn on the engine<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>m</kbd>. (long start-up sequence, hold for >10s or it will die, for first 5 sec nothing will happen)</li>
<li>Give it some gas <kbd>Num +</kbd> or the engine will shut down. Let it idle for a long  moment.</li>
<li>Shift it into gear <kbd>Num /</kbd>. Trolley moves. Has eight levels of power/gas (<kbd>Num +</kbd> <kbd>Num -</kbd>) and four gears (including the neutral <kbd>Num /</kbd> <kbd>Num *</kbd>)</li>
<li>Brake with the hand brake <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>num1</kbd> (release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>num7</kbd>)</li></ol>
<br><br>
<br><b>DRIVING EMUs</b><br>
Applies to: ED72, EN57. Method of driving of the EMUs is very similar to the electric locomotive method. However, there is no separate 'bypass' lever. It is included on the power controller, as the controller moves up onto the highest positions. Additionally, when setting the reverser, it has two forward positions (2 razy <kbd>d</kbd> from initial position) to the &#8222;Forwards II&#8221; position. It allows for faster acceleration than &#8222;Forwards I&#8221;. We use it (Forw. II) mainly when we intend on going over 70-80 km/h.<br>In the EMUs, we additionally have the :<br><kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>,</kbd>/<kbd>,</kbd> open/close  left doors<br><kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>.</kbd>/<kbd>.</kbd> open/close right doors<br><kbd>/</kbd> door closing signal<br><br><br>ED72, EN57 - Braking method (Oerlikon electropneumatic version)<br> While in motion the handle should be in the &quot;Running&quot; position <kbd>Num 4</kbd>.<br>When we want to brake we let the air into the cylinders. We put the handle in the "EP Braking" position (<kbd>Num 3</kbd> key), and then we return to "Running" position (<kbd>Num 9</kbd> or <kbd>Num 4</kbd>). Amount of air in the cylinders, and thus the braking force depend on how long we had the handle in the &quot;EP Braking&quot;. If we are braking too quickly, we can release some air from the cylinders, or unbrake completly. In that case move the handle into the "Releasing" position <!-- [Num 9] or [Num .] -->- hold the <kbd>Num .</kbd> key. <!-- Next we return the handle to the 'Running' position (in reality it automatically returns, but this has not yet been implemented). -->When we stop pressing <!-- [Num 9] (or [Num .])--> <kbd>Num .</kbd> the handle automatically returns into 'Running' position.<br><br><br>EN57 braking method (Electropneumatic Knorr version)<br>[Only in the EN57-001 in  The Sim]<br>After The Sim has started we need to unbrake the train - <kbd>Num .</kbd>.<br>While in motion the handle should be in the &quot;EP Release, PN Running&quot; position <kbd>Num 4</kbd>.<br>When we want to brake, we let the air into the cylinders. In order to do that we place the handle in the "EP Braking" position (klawisz <kbd>Num 3</kbd>) and we press the little lever under the handle (use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key). We let go of the little lever and move the handle to the &quot;EP Release, PN Running&quot; position (<kbd>Num 9</kbd> or <kbd>Num 4</kbd>). Braking force depends on the amount of time the handle (with the lever activated!!!) remained in the &quot;EP braking&quot;. If we are braking too quickly we can let some air out, or unbrake the whole train completly. To do that we activate the little lever <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br>
<br><b>DRIVING THE ET22-2000</b><br>Simplified operating manual - ET22 locomotive 2000 Series.<br>
<br>After raising the pantograph please turn on the monitor: <kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>;</kbd><br>Next we do just the same as in a traditional ET22: main circuit breaker, transformer, compressor.<br>After releasing the brakes (brake usage and method the same as in old/unmodernised ET22) choose the travel direction - <kbd>d</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>.<br><br>Start up method is as follows:<br><br>1.1 Power controller<br><br>&nbsp;Power controller has 4 positions marked: &#8222;0&#8221;, &#8222;-&#8221;, &#8222;=&#8221;, &#8222;+&#8221;.<br><br>a) &#8222;0&#8221; position &#8212; no power: motors are disconnected from the power source - no tractive effort;<br><br>b) &#8222;-&#8221; position &#8212; tractive effort decrease: when held in this position, the tractive effort is decreased;<br><br>c) &#8222;=&#8221; position &#8212; setting the tractive effort: the tractive effort is kept constant in the nearest long-term driving position;<br><br>d) &#8222;+&#8221; position &#8212; tractive effort increase: tractive effort is constantly being increased untill max tractive effort has been reached.<br><br>1.2 Using the power controller:<br><br>a) Acceleration: To accelerate, put the handle into the &#8222;+&#8221; position for a while and then return it to the &#8222;=&#8221; position. The vehicle will automatically choose the nearest long-term driving position.<br><br>b) Speed setting: hold the handle in the  &#8222;-&#8221; position untill the choosen long-term position has been reached. If the lever returns to the &#8222;=&#8221; position occurs on a resistive position, the vehicle will automatically choose  the higher long-term driving position. For example: to move to the S position from R, you need to wait untill all R and SR position have been skipped. If the handle is returned too soon, an R or SR position will be choosen instead.<br><br>c) Rolling or braking: There are two ways to start unpowered rolling: directly moving the handle to the &#8222;0&#8221; position or holding the handle in the &#8222;-&#8221; position untill the current is cut-off. Then it can be moved to the &#8222;N&#8221; position.
<br><br><b>DRIVING THE ET42</b>
<br>The general driving method is the same, as with all other electric locomotives. However, certain functions characterisitic only to this series have been added.<br><br>1. Turn on the speedometer and the indicator lights.<br><br>In the real ET42 locomotive, the controls need to be turned on using a switch on the panel. Without it, the switches and the speedometer will not be powered up. To turn it on, press the <kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>></kbd> keys.<br><br>2. Electrodynamic brake operation.<br><br>ET42 has a electrodynamic brake, but it works differently than, say, the EP09. It is operated by putting the Motor Bypass into the -1 position (using the <kbd>Num *</kbd> key) and then increasing the braking power by operating the power controller (<kbd>Num +</kbd>). If you are sure that you did everything correctly, and the locomotive still won't move when you put the power controller into the first position, go down to 0 (<kbd>Num -</kbd>) and press <kbd>Num /</kbd>. It causes the bypass switch to swithc into neutral (thus disabling the ED brake) and allows it to move.<br><br>3. Separate high and low tone horn buttons.<br><br>In the ET42, the high and the low horns are separate buttons. Low tone is operated like in the rest of the locos, using <kbd>a</kbd> key. However, the high tone is used by the BELL, which is connected onto the <kbd>/</kbd> key.<br><br>4. Changing the motor connections.<br><br>In the ET42 locomotive, the <i>Higher Motor Current Limit</i> does not work. Using the <kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>f</kbd> keys causes the way the motors are connected to change (Series - Parallel), which helps with getting a very heavy train to start and to maintain low speed, without using the resistors. When driving on the changed connections, the power controller goes up to only the 25th position and <i>Motor Bypass Controller</i>> is locked out of use. To return the motor connections to normal, put the power controller to 0 ( <kbd>Num -</kbd> key) and press <kbd>f</kbd>. After carrying out the  above procedure you can continue with driving the train.<br><br>ATTENTION!<br><br>The AI has problems with driving the ET42 series. It is caused by the ED brake. The AI sets the Bypass controller to -1, which is why it can't start the locomotive. In order for the AI to use the ET42 you need to give it (AI) the "dumb" version (<i>112edumb-a</i> and <i>112edumb-b</i>). To find out how to write scenario entries for trains <a href="en-entries.html"> go to the website containing the description</a>. To do this requires interfering with MaSzyna's files, and thus is NOT RECOMMENDED for new users.

Maybe now you thought to yourself:<br> "Hm. Very well. I know how to control locos and EMUs. I know how to start and stop, but I don't know when. How do you know how fast to go, when to start braking etc.?"<br><br>While driving, it is very important to observe the signals, signs and the timetable.
